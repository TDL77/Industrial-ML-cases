# Public industrial datasets and benchmarks
Here we propose datasets applicable for benchmarking of the following industrial problems:
- Recommendations and Optimisations
- Anomaly detection (faults and failures)
- RUL (remaining usefull life) and TTF (time-to-failure)
- Product quality
- Safety and access control
- Other

## Datasets
| Name+link | Brief description | License | Created (last update) |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB)](https://github.com/waico/SKAB) | SKAB (Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark) is designed for evaluating algorithms for anomaly detection. The benchmark currently includes 30+ datasets plus Python modules for algorithms’ evaluation. Each dataset represents a multivariate time series collected from the sensors installed on the testbed. All instances are labeled for evaluating the results of solving outlier detection and changepoint detection problems. | GPL-3.0 | 2020 (2021) |
| [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](https://github.com/numenta/NAB) | NAB is a novel benchmark for evaluating algorithms for anomaly detection in streaming, real-time applications. It is comprised of over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism designed for real-time applications. | AGPL-3.0 | 2015 (2019) |
| [NASA Shuttle Valve Data](https://cs.fit.edu/~pkc/nasa/data/) | The time series data are solenoid current measurements on a Marotta MPV-41 series valve as the valve is cycled on and off under various test conditions in a laboratory. The valves are used to control fuel flow on the Space Shuttle. | - | 2005 |
| [Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite and the Curiosity Rover on Mars](https://github.com/khundman/telemanom) | The raw data available for download represents real spacecraft telemetry data and anomalies from the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite (SMAP) and the Curiosity Rover on Mars (MSL). | Apache 2.0 | - |
